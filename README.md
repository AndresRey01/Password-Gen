# Password Generator

For this project I was tasked to create a functioning password generator using JavaScript to allow users that interact, to create a password ranging from 8 to 128 characters, using lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters! I hope this deployed site can be useful to many users, and I will more than likely use it myself!
